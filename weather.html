                    <p>by George P. Sinclair</p>
                    <p>MAny people scoffed at the idea of such a young dog running for mayor but lo and behold we now have our youngest acting mayor, dog or human. With only three weeks away from election day Spring found herself down 4 points in the polls but has seen a surge due in small part to her oppponents string of public accusations of being a "not chill dude". </p>
